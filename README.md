# Mastermind

In the last years I have been keeping my [hanoi tower](https://github.com/c0m3tx/hanoi-tower/) repository "up to date" with more and more programming languages.

I decided it would be fun to do the same with Mastermind, even though it's obviously a bit more complex, so here we are!

## Contributing
Even though I would love to do the "base implementation" for each language on my own, improvement suggestion and fixes are welcome! 

Please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
